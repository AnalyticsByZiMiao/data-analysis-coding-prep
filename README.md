# data-analysis-coding-prep
This repository is my personal coding gym for data analysis interviews. It contains well-commented solutions to real-world SQL, Python(Pandas), and A/B testing problems from Niuke, LeetCode, and real company interviews. Solutions are categorized by topic (e.g., window functions, user retention) for focused practice and review.
